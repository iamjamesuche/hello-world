# hello-world
This is my first repo on GitHub, this should be fun!


Hi there,

I'm James Uche, a fresh graduate of human anatomy.

Overtime I've developed a keen interest in data analysis

and have gradually become obsessed with the idea of 

data analytics as a fulfilling career.

I intend to specialise in biomedical data analytics which

will keep me in line with my core area of studyin Life sciences (Anatomy).


I expect a wonderful experience ✌🏾
